<h1>Running Python Scripts in Google Colab</h1>

<p>This guide will show you how to upload and run Python scripts in a Google Colab environment.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Upload Python Files:</strong>
        <p>Upload your Python script files to your Google Colab environment. You can do this using the "Files" tab on the left or by using the <code>!wget</code> or <code>!curl</code> commands to fetch files from the web.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Run Python Scripts:</strong>
        <p>Open a code cell in your Colab notebook and use Python to execute your script. For example, if your script is named "my_script.py," you can run it with:</p>
        <pre><code>!python my_script.py</code></pre>
        <p>Ensure that you navigate to the correct directory using <code>cd</code> if necessary before running your script.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>View Output:</strong>
        <p>The script will run, and you'll see the output in the Colab notebook. You can interact with the script's results and see any print statements or visualizations it generates.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! You've successfully uploaded and run Python scripts in Google Colab.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
